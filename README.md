# inertial-flow-app

Personal project to practice python, tensorflow, and get my hands wet with some web development.  This is not intended for actual deployment (because of security reasons) however I was able to deploy it on my home Linux server that I set up.

Contains a wrapper for tensorflow that can read in a JSON file, configure a network based on that file, train the network, and show the results.  Built a Fask micro server to serve the pages with an Angular front end. By no means is this professional but I learned a lot about web development and server setups.  I have no intention of becoming a professional web developer but have to work with them on a regualr basis so I figured I should understand their world a bit.
